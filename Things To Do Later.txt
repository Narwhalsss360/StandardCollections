- Things To Do Later - 
-Restructure files to more of a standard, maybe a src directory, base
implementation directory and actual collection.
	/docs -> documentation of library.
	/examples -> samples and examples of library usage
	/include -> public header files (maybe just StandardCollections.h) <- Test
	for arduino's compiler recursive include.
	/lib -> other (these notes)
	directories 1 up from sln. Maybe not include in release.
	/src -> all source files. (Maybe all exepct StandardCollections.h)
	/test -> test project. Maybe not include in release.
