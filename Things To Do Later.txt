-Restructure files to more of a standard, maybe a src directory, base
implementation directory and actual collection.
	/docs -> documentation of library.
	/examples -> samples and examples of library usage
	/include -> public header files (maybe just StandardCollections.h) <- Test for arduino's compiler recursive include.
	/lib -> Solution? and other (these notes)<- Test if possible to reference project directories 1 up from sln.
	/src -> all source files. (Maybe all exepct StandardCollections.h)
	/test -> test project
