Things to fix:
	-Fix forced copying of zip

Things to check
	-Check if nullref is defined behavior and will NOT cause crash

Features to add:
	Collection<CollectableType>:
		-MoveTo()
		-CopyTo()

	General:
		-Add wrapper for iterating through already instantiated begin and end

	Cast to example: Collection<double> -> Collection<int>


Things to do later:
	-Restructure files to more of a standard, maybe a src directory,
	base implementation directory and actual collection.
