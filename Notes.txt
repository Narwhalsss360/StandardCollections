Things to fix:
	-Fix forced copying of zip
	-Enumerate(begin, end)
		Enumeration is constructed using default constructor

Things to check
	-Check if nullref is defined behavior and will NOT cause crash

Features to add:
	Cast to example: Collection<double> -> Collection<int>

Things to do later:
	-Restructure files to more of a standard, maybe a src directory,
	base implementation directory and actual collection.
